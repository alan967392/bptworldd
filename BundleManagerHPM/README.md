An easy way for developers to make their Bundles (apps/drivers/libraries) available to everyone.

Hubitat now offers developers a way to work with libraries. Making it much easier and faster to develop a code base. The downside it that it made it a little harder to upload that work to GitHub. So I went about trying to come up with a new way to work with Bundles!
